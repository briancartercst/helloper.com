    <p>My git repo for this site, including the full Drupal setup, is now public on GitHub.</p>
<p>To get a full view of how everything works I'm also providing a database dump (with some sensitive information removed).</p>

<p>Please note that this is my playground and sometimes things gets messy. I don't claim everything to be best practice.</p>
<p>I'll highlight some of the things I do in my theme in separate blog posts in a couple of days.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
