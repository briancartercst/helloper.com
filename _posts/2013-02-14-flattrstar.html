<p>Today is Valentine's Day and what could be better than to give more love to those who share stuff you like?</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> then head over to their site and watch the short video that explains it well.</p>

<p>By using <a href="http://www.flattrstar.com">Flattrstar</a> you can flattr tweets, photos, videos and other content automatically. You just connect it to Flattr and pick the services you want to use. The site is all in German but you can probably guess how to use it or just use Google Translate.</p>
