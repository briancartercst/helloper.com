Five and a half years ago I released one of the first free high quality responsive WordPress themes: [Blaskan](https://blaskan.net). After being around for some time it got approved on both [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/themes/blaskan/) and [WordPress.com](https://theme.wordpress.com/themes/blaskan/). 

Among its most famous users were Toni Schneider, who at the time was the CEO of Automattic – the company behind WordPress. If you’re a swede you surely know about the podcast [Värvet](http://www.värvet.se) by Kristoffer Triumf. He’s been a Blaskan user since the start in 2012.

For the last two years I’ve had a hard time giving it the time it needs and development has stagnated. I’m therefore happy to announce that I’m passing the torch over to [Aigars Silkalns](https://twitter.com/aigarssilkalns) and his company [Colorlib](https://colorlib.com). Aigars is a extremely experienced WordPress developer and I’m sure Blaskan will have a great future in his hands. 

Finally I’d like to thank everyone that’s been contributing with translations, bug reports, ideas and support all these years. It’s been a pleasure!
