<p>An era has come to an endâ€¦</p>
<p>When I was getting started as a young web designer in the late 90s <a href="http://k10k.net">K10k</a> was one of the sites that made me fall in love with graphic design and web development. They were true pioneers and such a great inspiration.</p>
<p>Thank you Toke, Michael and Per for making it happen.</p>
