    <p>I just released my first WordPress plugin. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bloglovin-follow/">Bloglovin Follow</a> enables you to easily add their <a href="http://www.bloglovin.com/widgets">follow button</a> to your pages, posts or custom post types as well as in a widget.</p>
<p>The plugin was developed for <a href="http://www.kollegorna.se">our</a> client <a href="http://rodeo.net">Rodeo Magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Not to forget, <a href="http://www.sproject.name">Piotr Sochalewski</a> deserves a honorable mention as much of the code was lifted and modified from his <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/facebook-likes-you/">Facebook Likes You!</a> plugin.</p>
