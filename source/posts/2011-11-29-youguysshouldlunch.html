<p><em>This is sort of a translation of the <a href="http://www.kollegorna.se/blogg/lunchaihop">blog post</a> I posted earlier today on my companys' swedish site.</em></p>

<p>Every second friday is free friday at <a href="http://www.kollegorna.se">Kollegorna</a> which means that everyone works with open source, learning new skills or works on internal or personal projects.</p>

<p>This last friday was such a day and I spent it together with <a href="#lunchaihop-team">a bunch of creative people</a> lead by <a href="http://www.youmewe.se">Jonas Larsson</a> developing the web app <a href="http://www.lunchaihop.se">Luncha ihop</a> and its' english companion <a href="http://www.youguysshouldlunch.com">You guys should lunch</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/bybalsam">Jonas</a> is looking for a new job as digital strategist and wanted to do something more than just a regular job application which led to the idea of <a href="http://www.lunchaihop.se">Luncha ihop</a> and <a href="http://www.youguysshouldlunch.com">You guys should lunch</a>.</p>

<p>The site lets you log in to LinkedIn, fetch your LinkedIn friends and let you encourage two of them to have a lunch together. You can also encourage one of them to have lunch with Jonas.
Regarding the production of the site <a href="http://www.kollegorna.se">we</a> did the frontend development, <a href="http://www.deportivo.se">Deportivo</a> did the design and <a href="http://www.teknograd.no">Teknograd</a> the backend development.</p>

<p>Last night we made a stealth launch and the full public release was this morning.<br>
The release has gone very well and some of the milestones we've reached so far are:</p>

<ul>
<li>At lunch, now that's good timing, the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23lunchaihop">#lunchaihop</a> was trending in Sweden. (The english hashtag is <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23youguysshouldlunch">#youguysshouldlunch</a>.)</li>
<li>At the time of this blog post over 330 persons will have a lunch based off the swedish site.</li>
<li>We've reached an audience of almost 240 000 users on Twitter (source: <a href="http://www.hashtracking.com/">HashTracking</a>) for <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23lunchaihop">#lunchaihop</a>.
<br>And don't miss the <a href="http://liveboard.twingly.com/lunchaihop">Twingly liveboard for #lunchaihop</a>.</li>
<li>Jonas has been able to check off a decent amount of people on his <a href="http://www.youguysshouldlunch.com/#info">wish list</a>.</li>
</ul>
