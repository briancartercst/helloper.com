    <p>I'm currently in the progress of finishing version 2.0 of the WordPress theme I <a href="/blaskan-wordpress-theme">released earlier this year</a>. <a href="http://www.blaskan.net">Blaskan</a> 2.0 will hopefully be done this weekend and soon after that finally be available on WordPress.org.
<br>The most significant improvements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS drop down menu (not my cup of tea but required for WordPress.org themes).</li>
<li>Sites with many menu items will use a select menu on smaller screens.</li>
<li>The CSS handling the responsive stuff have been completely refactored and moved to a separate file making creating child themes much easier.</li>
<li>IE6 support dropped. It's working good enough though.</li>
</ul>
