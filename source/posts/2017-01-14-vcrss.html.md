[VCRSS](https://github.com/persand/vcrss) is a ruby script I wrote that automatically downloads videos my kids like from [SVT Play](http://www.svtplay.se) using [svtplay-dl](https://svtplay-dl.se) and from [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) using [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/).

Get it on GitHub: [persand/vcrss](https://github.com/persand/vcrss)

## How to use it

The project [README](https://github.com/persand/vcrss/blob/master/README.md) will guide you.

## How I use it

The git repo is cloned to one of my Raspberry Pis. On that I have one cron job that runs vcrss.rb every 10th minute and another cron job that moves the video files to the proper locations on the family NAS.

Some of my config.yml:

```yaml
feeds:
  - url: "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCvpNIQlTMpDfR8kv9Z64f5g"
    filters:
      - "Babblarna"
  - url: "http://www.svtplay.se/greta-gris/rss.xml"
    binary: "svtplay-dl"
    options: " -f -S -o 'downloads/'"
  - url: "http://www.svtplay.se/andys-dinosaurieaventyr/rss.xml"
    binary: "svtplay-dl"
    options: " -f -S -o 'downloads/'"
  - url: "http://www.svtplay.se/hej-jycke/rss.xml"
    binary: "svtplay-dl"
    options: " -f -S -o 'downloads/'"
```

That's all. Happy downloading!
