Nice to meet you!

I’m Per Sandström a Swedish web designer and developer. You can get in touch with me via email, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Keybase.

Since 1999 I’ve been designing, developing and leading web projects both for a living and for fun. I have a chronic thirst for knowledge and approach things through thinking, challenging and problem solving. I love building things and thrive in creative and prestigeless environments where creating value is what really matters.
