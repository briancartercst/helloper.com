## Nice to meet you!

Since 1999 Iâ€™ve been designing, developing and leading web projects both for a living and for fun. I have a chronic thirst for knowledge and approach things through thinking, challenging and problem solving. I love building things and thrive in creative and prestigeless environments where creating value is what really matters.
