Although not as impressive as [Mr Stallmans](https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html) but here goes:

<hr>

My primary computer is a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) with a 3 GHz Intel Core i7 and 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 memory. Prior to that I had a Macbook Air but unfortunately killed it with a latte. To make things I use Sublime Text, Sketch, Pixelmator and iA Writer. I’m also running Windows 10 through Parallels Desktop and I’m really enjoying how Microsoft is progressing these days.

I keep my old Macbook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2011) as a machine to perform various experiments on.

A plethora of Raspberry Pis of different models that I use for [gaming](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-turn-your-raspberry-pi-into-a-retro-game-console-498561192), [watching](https://kodi.tv), [listening to music](http://www.pimusicbox.com) and various hardware projects.

An iPhone SE. I’m liking this tiny model. My hands aren’t fit to operate heavier machinery.

I used to have an own iPad but these but my kids has taken it from me.

At the office I use an 27” Apple Thunderbolt Display and at home a 32” Philips BDM3270QP/00.

Other gadgets: Panasonic Lumix GX1, GoPro Hero4 Session and Withings Go.
