## Computers and other electronics

My primary computer is a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) with a 3 GHz Intel Core i7 and 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 memory. Prior to that I had a Macbook Air, but unfortunately killed it with a latte. To make things I use Sublime Text, Sketch, Pixelmator, Photoshop and iA Writer. To be able to follow the progress of Microsoft I run Windows 10 through Parallels Desktop.

I keep my old Macbook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2011) as a machine to perform various experiments on.

A plethora of Raspberry Pis of different models that I use for [video recording](/blog/2017/01/vcrss/), [gaming](https://retropie.org.uk), [watching](https://kodi.tv), [listening to music](http://www.pimusicbox.com) and misc hardware projects.
