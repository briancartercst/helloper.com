## Own ventures 

As if building things for clients wasn’t enough we also do own projects. The most prominent of those are…

[Releasefest](https://www.releasefest.se)  
A community driven website where we celebrate swedish digital products and services. Somewhat like ProductHunt but with just swedish sites, services, apps, campaigns and more.

[The Kong Initiative](http://www.konginitiative.com)  
Getting your hands on extra wide snowboards has always been hard for europeans. We aim to change that by specializing in only the widest boards on the market. We ship to the entire EU as well as Norway and Switzerland.

[GPX.io](http://gpx.io)  
Show off your activity in a simple way on a map. You don’t print and frame all your photos – but you do with those that are special. GPX.io helps you frame your most significant activities.
