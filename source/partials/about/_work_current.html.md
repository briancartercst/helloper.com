Founder & Head of Production at Kollegorna
2010 – today
We’re a digital agency that helps clients building products and services.

We primarily do:

- Concepts
- Strategy
- Brand Identities
- UX and UI design
- Development

How:

We build most of our stuff using Ruby on Rails as well as some Go, Node.js, Ember.js and WordPress all depending on the project.

For:

Among our clients are both privately held and listed companies, startups, organisations, NGOs and government authorities. Our mothership is in Stockholm, but as we’re a distributed agency  we’re spread from Santo Domingo in the west to Plovdiv.

Own ventures:

As if building things for clients wasn’t enough we also do own projects. The most prominent of those are…

### Releasefest
A community driven website where we celebrate swedish digital products and services. Somewhat like ProductHunt but with just swedish sites, services, apps, campaigns and more.

### GPX.io
Show off your activity in a simple way on a map. You don’t print and frame all your photos – but you do with those that are special. GPX.io helps you frame your most significant activities.

### The Kong Initiative
Getting your hands on extra wide snowboards has always been hard for europeans. We aim to change that by specializing in only the widest boards on the market. We ship to the entire EU as well as Norway and Switzerland.
