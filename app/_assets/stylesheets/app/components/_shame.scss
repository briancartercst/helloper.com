 *
 * The Rules:
 *
 * 1. If itâ€™s a hack, it goes in shame.css.
 * 2. Document all hacks fully:
 *    a) What part of the codebase does it relate to?
 *    b) Why was this needed?
 *    c) How does this fix it?
 *    d) How might you fix it properly, given more time?
 * 3. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then
 *    their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
 * 4. Try and clean shame.css up when you have some down time.
 *    a) Even better, get a tech-debt story in which you can dedicate actual
 *    sprint time to it.
